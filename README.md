### Solar Panel Simulation

**Concepts:** Interactive Web App Development, API's, Data Transformation, Data Analytics, Data Visualization

**Software & Languages:** R, System Advisor Model (SAM), PVWatts

**Packages:** shiny, rsconnect, shinythemes, shinydashboard, DT, tidyverse, shinyalert, shinyBS, shinyjs, leaflet, zipcodeR, plotly, lubridate, httr, reshape2, writexl, xlsx, readxl

**Description:** With this solar panel simulation application, users can enter zipcode, solar panel/system, and financial inputs to run a simulation that provides analysis of energy and financial outputs based on a certain location's weather data. The weather data used is a typical meteorological year (TMY) file which represents the average weather conditions over a select year range. It is extracted from the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) and run through the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) SAM model. Outputs are visualized through plots and tables at an annual, monthly, and hourly basis. This project is one of the apps developled during my student assistantship with the Terry College of Business - Management Information Systems and Physics department at the University of Georgia.
